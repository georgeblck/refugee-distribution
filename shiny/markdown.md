## What

In September 2015 the European Commission proposed a plan to relocate 120'000 refugees from Greece, Italy & Hungary to all European countries. 
This was supposed to be done by a *mandatory distribution key using objective and quantifiable criteria*, consisting of the following variables and weightings:
> * the size of the population (40%, positive weight),
> * the GDP (40%, positive weight),
> * the average number of past asylum applications (10%, negative weight) and
> * the unemployment rate (10%, negative weight).

The details and consequences of this proposal are in itself very interesting but are not important here.

We wanted to take this idea of a distribution key one step further and 

## How 
what needs to be done is...
#### The Sliders

* The first four sliders can be used to adjust the weightings of the distribution key. The original setting (0.4/0.4/0.1/0.1) is the one proposed by the EU. The values and limits of the sliders are reactive to each other and can sometimes make problems!
* The fifth slider determines 
	* how many refugees are to be distributed (by specifing the year range) and
	* on which data the distribution key is calculated (the year **prior** to the lower range)

#### The advanced options

* Absolute/ratios (only Bar-Plot): The ratios are good because they are independent of *how many* refugees shall be distributed! However, most should find the absolute numbers more interesting.
* Per Capita Asylum Applications (only Table): This should be self explanatory!
* Country groups: This should also be self explanatory!
* Data Sources: We provide different data sources for the Asylum Applications (not the Accepted ones) because why not?
* Which Key: The Grech-Key should always be used as it corrected two big flaws of the EU key (read up in Grech's article). We provide the original only because it is the original.

## Why

There are two main reasons for this visualization. We want to

1. provide an easily accesisble overview of the distribution of (accepted) Asylum Applications in the EU
2. provide a sensible and changeable benchmark of how many/whare share of refugees each country should accept 

Summed up, we wanted to put the omnipresent discussion of certain European countries taking too few/many refugees on a more factual basis.

Naturally, this premise depends greatly on the quality of the data. That is why we were very dilligent in choosing the data sets (see the section below).

## Data sources
All of the data was accessed between the 11th and 14th of June, 2016. We haven't made an effort to incorporate the most recent data but this will happen in the future.

#### Eurostat
The biggest part of data came from [Eurostat](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat). We used the following data sets:
* Annual **GDP** in current prices in Euro (code: nama_10_gdp)
* **Population** on the 1st of January (code: demo_pjan)
* Annual average of the **unemployment rate** (code: une_rt_a)
* **Asylum Applications** (both All Instances and only First Instances)
	* Monthly data from 2008 up to May 2016 (code: migr_asyappctzm)
	* Monthly data from 1999 till 2007 (code: migr_asyctzm & migr_asyctz)
* Quarterly rounded data on **Accepted Asylum Applications** (code: migr_asydcfstq)

#### UNHCR
To provide another source, data on Asylum Applications was also taken from the [UNHCR database on Population Statistics](http://popstats.unhcr.org/en/overview). Specifically the monthly data on Asylum-Seekers from 1999 to April 2016.

Regarding the distinction between novel and repeated Asylum Applications, we quote from the UNHCR webpage:
> Where possible, figures exclude repeat/re-opened asylum applications and applications lodged on appeal or with courts. 

#### Missing data (Liechtenstein & Switzerland)

* Unemployment data for Liechtenstein was taken from [here](http://www.llv.li/#/11432/arbeitslosenstatistik)
* Unemployment data for Switzerland was taken from [here](http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/03/03/blank/data/01.html)
* GDP data for Liechtenstein was taken from [here](http://etab.llv.li/PXWeb/pxweb/de/?rxid=3bd05ee8-fc11-4982-a9af-aae15ce602c4). As the currency is CHF, exchange rates from Eurostat (code: ert_bil_eur_a) were needed.
* GDP data for Switzerland in the year 2015 is still missing!
